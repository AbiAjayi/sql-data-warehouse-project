# SQL-Data-Warehouse-Project
## 1. Introduction
### 1.1 Project Overview
This project focuses on developing a data warehouse using SQL Server to centralize sales data, enable analytical reporting, and support data-driven decision-making. The project follows best practices in data engineering, including efficient data integration, schema design, and performance optimization. It transforms raw data into actionable insights through advanced analytics while ensuring data integrity and scalability.

### 1.2 Business Problem
Organizations face challenges in managing large-scale data efficiently. These include:
-	Disparate data sources leading to inefficiencies in analysis.
-	Poor data quality affecting business decision-making.
-	Performance issues in querying large datasets.
A structured data warehouse addresses these challenges by providing a centralized repository with clean, business-ready data.

## 2. Data Architecture
### 2.1 Medallion Architecture (Bronze, Silver, Gold Layers)
The project adopts a multi-layered approach:
-	Bronze Layer: Raw data ingestion from CSV files into SQL Server without transformations.
-	Silver Layer: Data cleaning, transformation, normalization, and quality checks.
-	Gold Layer: Business-ready, structured data optimized for reporting using the Star Schema.
### 2.2 Schema Design
The data warehouse schema follows the Star Schema approach with:
-	Fact Table: Sales Transactions (OrderID, CustomerID, ProductID, Amount, Date)
-	Dimension Tables: Customers, Products, Time, Locations
### 2.3 Data Sources
Data is ingested from:
-	CSV Files containing transactional sales data.
-	ERP Files

## 3. ETL Process
### 3.1 Data Extraction
-	CSV files are loaded into staging tables using SQL Serverâ€™s BULK INSERT.
-	Data is extracted from transactional databases.
### 3.2 Data Transformation
-	Standardization of column formats.
-	Handling missing values and duplicate records.
-	Derived column creation and normalization.
### 3.3 Data Loading
-	Stored Procedures used to transform and load data into the Gold Layer.
-	Indexing and partitioning techniques applied for performance optimization.
## 4. Data Modeling
### 4.1 Fact and Dimension Tables
-	Fact Table: Sales_Fact (OrderID, CustomerID, ProductID, SalesAmount, OrderDate)
-	Dimension Tables: 
 -	Customer_Dim (CustomerID, Name, Location, Segment)
 -	Product_Dim (ProductID, Name, Category, Price)
 -	Time_Dim (DateID, Year, Month, Day, Weekday)
### 4.2 Performance Optimization
-	Indexing on foreign keys for faster joins.
-	Partitioning large tables for efficient querying.
-	Views created for user-friendly access to aggregated data.

## 5. Analytics and Business Intelligence
### 5.1 Querying the Data Warehouse
-Complex SQL queries written for analytical insights.
-	Use of window functions, CTEs, and aggregations for trend analysis.
### 5.2 Data Visualization with Power BI
-	Interactive dashboards for tracking sales performance.
-	Key metrics displayed: Revenue Trends, Top-Selling Products, Customer Segmentation.
### 5.3 Business Insights
-	Identified peak sales periods for marketing strategies.
-	Customer behavior analysis led to improved product recommendations.
-	Optimization of inventory management based on sales trends.

## 6. Challenges and Solutions
-	Data Quality Issues: Resolved using rigorous validation checks.
-	Performance Bottlenecks: Addressed through indexing and optimized query execution plans.
-	ETL Failures: Handled by implementing error logging and automated retries.

## 7. Conclusion and Future Enhancements
### 7.1 Summary of Achievements
-	Successfully built a scalable and optimized data warehouse.
- Improved data integrity and accessibility for decision-makers.
### 7.2 Future Enhancements
-	Automation of ETL pipelines to reduce manual intervention.
-	Integration with cloud platforms for real-time analytics.
-	Advanced machine learning models for predictive insights.

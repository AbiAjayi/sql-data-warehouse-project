# SQL-Data-Warehouse-Project
Developing a data warehouse using SQL Server, covering ETL processes, data modeling, and analytics. This project demonstrates a comprehensive approach to data warehousing and analytics, from building the data warehouse to generating actionable insights. It showcases best practices in data engineering, including efficient data integration, schema design, and performance optimization. Additionally, it emphasizes using advanced analytics to turn raw data into meaningful business intelligence, ensuring data integrity, scalability, and effective reporting.

### Objective
Create a modern data warehouse using SQL Server to centralize sales data, enable analytical reporting, and support data-driven decision-making.

### Project Overview
This project involves: 
- Data Architecture: - Designing a modern data warehouse using the Medallion architecture Bronze, silver, and gold layer.
                   - The bronze layer contains the raw data from the data source 
                   - The silver layer contains cleaned and standardized data, while the gold layer has views and business-ready data for analytical and reporting purposes
- ETL Pipelines: Extracting, transforming, and loading data from the source systems into the data warehouse
- Data Modeling: Developing the facts and dimension tables for analytical queries

### Data Architecture
The data architecture of this project follows the medallion architecture Bronze, Silver and Gold layers:
